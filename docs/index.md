# Welcome to the Knowledge Management Analyst content review

This site contains the documentation for [Publishing to snowflake from delta - stream](documentation.md). It is intended to showcase a content management and distribution method for technical documentation known as **docs-as-code**. In theory, the site would be open to contribution from approved team members. The contribution method is described [about section](about.md) of this guide. Please feel free to browse the site utilizing the navigation menus and/or search bar.

### Purpose
The benefits of a docs-as-code approach to documentation are:

* Keeping documentation and code in sync
* Searchable content
* Using the same tools to review documentation and code
* Writer - developer collaboration
* Automated publishing
* Versioning
* Source control
